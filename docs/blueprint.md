## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep red (#C92A1D) to evoke feelings of vitality, health, and emergency, aligned with the critical nature of blood donation.
- Background color: Very light red (#F8E6E4) to complement the primary color while maintaining a clean and modern look. It is only slightly different in hue from the primary color, but is very desaturated, as needed for a background color.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#D15A2D), a similar hue, but visibly different in both saturation and brightness. To be used for calls to action, highlights, and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use heart or blood drop icons from FontAwesome or Lucide to reinforce the theme, but favor simplicity in the style of those icons.
- Employ a responsive layout using Tailwind CSS for adaptability across devices, ensuring optimal user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Implement soft hover effects and transitions to enhance interactivity and provide a polished user experience.
